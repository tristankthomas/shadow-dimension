The scientists thought they could control these creatures but alas they failed and are being held captive in the Over Under. Navec has created sinkholes that will destroy the lab and is planning on eventually destroying your world. The playerâ€™s name is Fae, the daughter of one of the scientists. In order to save your father and your town, you need to avoid the sinkholes, find the gate in the lab and defeat Navec & his demons in the Over Under. . .*"
